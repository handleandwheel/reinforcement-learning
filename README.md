### Reindorcement Learning

This repo implements some classic reinforcement learning algorithms. Each file should be able to run individually. Most of the code only implement the algorithm but optimized, so algorithms may not run efficiently.

The implemented algorithms are as follows:

- vanilla policy gradient (VPG)
- proximal policy optimization (PPO)
- deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)
- twin delayed DDPG (TD3)
- updating...
